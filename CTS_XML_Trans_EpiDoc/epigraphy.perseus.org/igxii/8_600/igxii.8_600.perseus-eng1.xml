          <p>Katillios, my noble consort, having placed this stone over Demetria, gave me a marvel 
        on account of our august bed. The law of the Fates provides life for the mortals.</p>

          <p>Even if you have a chest that is fair in appearance, yet my soul is going towards the clear 
          sky from me; I will speak clearly; the divinity gave to the young men to talk as if they were 
          alive with all the people who live on earth after the fate of death. But I was neither singing 
          in a wide choral with virgins, (for indeed, she grieved for me as I was dead, my sorrowful mother), 
          nor did my noble father bring me in the bridal chambers, entering there at his feet as a wedded 
          wife; instead, as I was still unwedded and tender-minded the Golden Fate came and took away the 
          hope of marriage. And my dear father made here with stones a grave, an eternal memorial, for his 
          eighteen year-old girl.</p>
