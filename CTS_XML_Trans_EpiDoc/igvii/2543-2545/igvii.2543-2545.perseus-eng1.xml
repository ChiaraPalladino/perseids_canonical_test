        <p>My parents cried over my body around the unfeeling grave  since this is the honor due to the dead, but my soul left for its just destination. 
        My name was Nedymos, a gentle child of the Italian Adae. I did not live for a long time, but I was born to live for only a few years;
        unstable time, you  did not go back, but followed your own course; whatever destiny one is allotted, he fulfills it; and that is the case even for kings.
        My father Zosimos wrote this for me, and in his longing for me forgot about my immortal soul.</p>
          </div>
        <div n="2544" type="textpart" xml:lang="en">
        <p>I am a marble stone, I bear a man in my belly, Nedymos; he is sleeping beautifully 
        and in the company of the dead; the people honored him with a gold crown.
        The council did this in consolation to his son; the body of a lion crouches over
        this man dear to Ares. His son Zosimos wrote this, because indeed this is the honor 
        due to the dead...And whoever would dare to place a body in my belly, to separate the 
        father from his son, who I keep in my belly, will be fined a large sum payable to the 
        city and to the treasury.</p>
          </div>
        <div n="2545" type="textpart" xml:lang="en">        
        <p>My load is full; this is well. For Nedymos lies here in my belly and from this child 
        a son was born, named Nedymos, and now the third, Zosimus, father of this child.
        Let one of the gods grant me to be closed and without seams; if someone reaches to open me, 
        let his hopes bear no fruit, may he have no grandchildren, but may his whole lineage be 
        completely uprooted.</p>
